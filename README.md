4. Eloquent ORM to handle & itterate with database;
5. Blade Template Engine to construct a dynamic template;
6. SQL to design the database schema;

#### For what i use Espreso?

Espreso was created to ensure that you have a fully and enjoiable experience with **Chocolatey**. Espreso allows you to manage the entire retro environment with advanced features.

#### How i can have a full experience with Espreso?

* **Espreso** uses the Arcturus Emulator Database Schema, like **Chocolatey**. In order to use **Espreso** you need download [Arcturus](http://arcturus.wf)
* Also **Chocolatey** only supports php 7.0+ environments, php 5.X is no longer supported.
* You can actually use **Chocolatey** in Apache HTTP Server 2.0+. For your security we recommend ModSecurity 2.
* To get Photo & Selfies Features in both **Espreso** & **Chocolatey** you need do a donation to the Open Source Project [Arcturus](http://arcturus.wf). It's totally optional. But it's an awesome show stopper feature.
